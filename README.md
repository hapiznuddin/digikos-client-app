# Digikos Web

This is my personal project to fulfill the assignment of my thesis by using ReactJS as a library and Tailwind CSS as a CSS framework. This project is a boarding house management information system website, which consists of a landing page, admin dashboard and user dashboard.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
